# PORTOFOLIO
## About me
```
Hello, My name is David Gorodetchi.
The dream of coming of age is about to come true.
Although I wanted to do computer programming after finishing school, 
I went in the direction of the job: more precisely, to work in the field of construction.
Later, after many years, I worked as a truck driver.
But, around 2020, I realized that I have an unfulfilled dream, namely to work in the IT field.
Recently I have started to be interested in software testing. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills. 
On the site 'github.com' I would like to share all my experience gained from personal studies and researches. 
In this order, I started an automated testing course at the end of 2022. Here I learned: 
Testing theory and basic concepts, Data Structures and Algorithms and OOP principles, automated web-selenium testing, 
API testing and also I learned the principles of relational databases.
```
```
I did a GitHub course. Here I learned important information about uploading and importing projects to GitHub, 
keeping projects up to date, resolving conflicts that may arise, and how to work with multiple branches.
```

### My goal is:
```
> to deepen automated testing,
> to deepen the Python and Java programming language,
and continue to develop the testing branch.
I study automated testing every day with great enthusiasm I would be happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product 
and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current carrer goal, to always become better at what I do.
```
### Among other strong points, I would like to mention what is predominant:
- Logical - I learn everything logically. I associate anything new with familiar things.
- Repetition - I don't like doing repeated things, but I always try to find different solutions.
- Integrity - My principles and values do not allow me to be incorrect, 
to cheat or to make errors that would affect inter-human relations.
- Relational - In their relationships with others, they don't take things personally,
which means that they easily get over certain conflicts, and try to maintain good relationships.
- Punctuality - I don't like to put things off, but to do them on time.
